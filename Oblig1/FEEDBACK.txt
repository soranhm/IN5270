Dear Soran,

I have taken a look at your first mandatory exercise, and you have passed.  Well done!

Your report is very nice, and the program is nicely structured and very readable.  Good job!

A couple of comments:
 * In exercise 1a), I think you mean 'centered difference' rather than 'backward Euler'.
 * It looks to me like there are a couple of minor typos.  You may want to have a final read through to eliminate as many of those as possible.
 * In exercise b) and c), I would consider formatting some of the calculations a little differently, and perhaps allowing some more space instead of trying to get everything in line with the text.

Hope these are helpful comments.


Kind regards,
James D. Trotter
